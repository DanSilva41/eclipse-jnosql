====  Pagination

Pagination is the process of separating the contents into discrete pages. Each page has a list of entities from the database. The pagination allows retrieving a considerable number of elements from datastore into small blocks, e.g., returns ten pages with one hundred elements instead of return one thousand in a big shot at the storage engine.

At this project, there an interface that represents the pagination there is the `Pagination` interface.

[source,java]

Pagination pagination = Pagination.page(1).size(2);
//it creates a pagination instance where it is the first page and each page has the size of two each one.

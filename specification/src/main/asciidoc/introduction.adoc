== Let's talk about standard to NoSQL database in Java

The NoSQL DB is a database that provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data, which is modeled by means, other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. These databases have speed and high scalability. This kind of database is becoming more popular in several applications, which include financial ones. As a result of the increase, the number of users and vendors are increasing too.

The NoSQL database is defined basically by its model of storage, and there are four types:

=== Key-value

.Key-value structure

This database has a structure that looks like a java.util.Map API, where we can store any value from a key.

*Examples:*

• Amazon Dynamo
• Amazon S3
• Redis
• Scalaris
• Voldemort


.Key-Value vs Relational structure
|===
| Relational structure | Key-value structure
| Table | Bucket
| Row | Key/value pair
| Column | ----
| Relationship | ----
|===

=== Document collection

.Document structure

This model can store any document without the need to predefine a structure. This document may be composed of numerous fields with many kinds of data, including a document inside another document. This model works either with XML or JSON file.

*Examples:*

* Amazon SimpleDB
* Apache CouchDB
* MongoDB


.Document vs Relational structure
|===
| Relational structure | Document Collection structure
| Table | Collection
| Row | Document
| Column | Key/value pair
| Relationship | Link
|===

=== Column Family

.Column Family structure

This model became popular with the Bigtable's paper by Google, with the goal of being a distributed system storage, projected to have either high scalability or volume.

*Examples:*

* HBase
* Cassandra
* Scylla
* Cloud Data
* SimpleDB


.Column Family vs Relational structure

| Relational structure | Column Family structure
| Table | Column Family
| Row | Column
| Column | Key/value pair
| Relationship | not supported

=== Graph

.Graph structure
image::graph.png[Graph structure]

In computing, a graph database is a database that uses graph structures for semantic queries with nodes, edges, and properties, to represent and store data.

* *Property*: A small component in the structure; a tuple where the key is the name, and the value is the information itself.
* *Vertex*: Looks like the table in an SQL technology that has an unlimited number of properties.
* *Edge*: The element that represents the relationship between vertices; it has a small similarity with a relationship in SQL. However, the edge has properties — so, a connection deeper than relational technology.

The graph direction is another concept pretty important in a graph structure, i.e., you can know a person despite this person not knowing you.

* *Out*: Vertex > action > vertex; the "out" is the "action" direction, moreover, the sample (i.e. I know the Ironman)

* *In*: Vertex > passive; the "in" is the reaction course; synonymously, the Ironman is known by me.

* *Both*: Refers to either direction IN or OUT

*Examples:*

* Neo4j
* InfoGrid
* Sones
* HyperGraphDB

| Relational Structure | Graph structure
| Table | Vertex and Edge
| Row | Vertex
| Column | Vertex and Edge property

=== Multi-model database

Some databases have support for more than one kind of model storage. This is the multi-model database.

*Examples:*

* OrientDB
* Couchbase

=== Scalability vs Complexity

Every kind with specific persistence structures to solve particular problems. As the graph below shows, there is a balance regarding model complexity; more complicated models are less scalable. E.g., a key-value NoSQL database is more scalable, but it has smooth complexity once all queries and operations are key-based.

=== BASE vs ACID
.BASE vs ACID
image::acid_vs_base.png[BASE vs ACID]

While in the relational persistence technology, they use the ACID, that is an acronym for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability.


* *Atomicity*: All of the operations in the transaction will complete, or none will.
* *Consistency*: The database will be in a consistent state when the transaction begins and ends.
* *Isolation*: The transaction will behave as if it is the only operation being performed upon the database.
* *Durability*: Upon completion of the transaction, the operation will not be reversed.


In the NoSQL world, they usually focus on the BASE. As ACID the BASE is an acronym.

* *Basic Availability*: The database appears to work most of the time.
* *Soft-state*: Stores don’t have to be write-consistent, nor do different replicas have to be mutually consistent all the time.
* *Eventual consistency*: Stores exhibit consistency at some later point (e.g., lazily at read time).

=== CAP Theorem
.CAP Theorem
image::cap.png[CAP Theorem]

The CAP theorem applies to distributed systems that store state. Eric Brewer, at the 2000 Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing (PODC), conjectured that in any networked shared-data system, there is a fundamental trade-off between consistency, availability, and partition.
Tolerance: In 2002, Seth Gilbert and Nancy Lynch of MIT published a formal proof of Brewer's conjecture. The theorem states that networked shared-data systems can only guarantee/strongly support two of the following three properties:


* *Consistency*: A guarantee that every node in a distributed cluster returns the same, most recent, successful write. Consistency refers to every client having the same view of the data. There are various types of consistency models. Consistency in CAP (used to prove the theorem) refers to linearizability or sequential consistency - a very strong form of consistency.
* *Availability*: Every non-failing node returns a response for all read and write requests in a reasonable amount of time. The key word here is “every.” To be available, every node (on either side of a network partition) must be able to respond in a reasonable amount of time.
* *Partition Tolerance*: The system continues to function and uphold its consistency guarantees in spite of network partitions. Network partitions are a fact of life. Distributed systems guaranteeing partition tolerance can gracefully recover from partitions once the partition heals.

=== The diversity in NoSQL

At the current moment, there are around two hundred and twenty-five NoSQL databases. These databases usually go beyond to support one or more types of structures, and they also have specific behavior. These particular features make the developer’s life more comfortable in different ways, such as Cassandra Query language at Cassandra database, a search engine to Elasticsearch, the live query at OrientDB, N1QL at Couchbase, and so on. These aspect matters when the topic is a NoSQL database.

=== Standard in SQL

Looking to Java application that uses a relational database, it's a good practice to have a layer bridge between a Java application and relationship database: a DAO - the data access object. Talking more about relational databases, there are APIs such as JPA and JDBC that have some advantages to a Java developer:


* There isn’t a lock-in vendor. In other words, with the standard, a database change will happen easier and with transparency because we just need to change a simple driver.
* It isn’t necessary to learn a new API for each new database once there is a common database communication.
* There isn’t an impact in change from one vendor to another; in some moments, it's necessary to use a specific database resource, but in this case, not everything in the DAO layer is lost.


Currently in NoSQL, database have no standard, so a Java developer has some issues:

* Lock-in vendor
* To each new database, it’s necessary to learn a new API. Any change to another database has a high impact, and once all the communication layer will be lost, there isn't a standard API. This happens even with the same kind of NoSQL database; for example, a change in a column to another column.


There is a massive effort to create a common API to make the Java developer's life easier, such as Spring Data, Hibernate ORM, and TopLink. The JPA is a popular API in the Java world, which is why all solutions try to use it. However, this API is created for SQL and not for NoSQL and doesn't support all behaviors in NoSQL database. Many NoSQL hasn’t a transaction, and many NoSQL database hasn’t support to asynchronous insertion.

The solution for this case would be the creation of a specification that covers the four kinds of NoSQL database; as described, each NoSQL database has specific structures that must be recognized. The new API should look like the JPA once the developer has familiarity with this API, plus be extensible when a database has more than a particular behavior. However, that cannot be JPA as JPA has the goal of a relational database instead of NoSQL. As described briefly, NoSQL has more than one structure that must be covered. They usually use BASE instead of ACID, they typically don't use SQL as a query language, schemeless, and so on.

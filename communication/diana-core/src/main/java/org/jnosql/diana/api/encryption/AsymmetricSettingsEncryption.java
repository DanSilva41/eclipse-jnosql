/**
 * Public-key cryptography, or asymmetric cryptography, is a cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys:
 * public keys which may be disseminated widely, and private keys which are known only to the owner.
 * The generation of such keys depends on cryptographic algorithms based on mathematical problems to produce one-way
 * functions. Effective security only requires keeping the private key private;
 * the public key can be openly distributed without compromising security.
 *

= Eclipse JNoSQL Diana Column


The JNoSQL communication API layer to column database.

== NoSQL column type
A column family is a NoSQL object that contains columns of related data. It is a tuple (pair) that consists of a key-value pair, where the key is mapped to a value that is a set of columns. In analogy with relational databases, a column family is as a "table", each key-value pair being a "row". Each column is a tuple (triplet) consisting of a column name, a value, and a timestamp. In a relational database table, this data would be grouped together within a table with other non-related data.

== Code structure
 
The Column API has the following structure:

* *ColumnConfiguration*: This interface represents the configuration whose a database has. These settings such as password, user, clients are storage and use to create a manager factory.
* *ColumnFamilyManagerFactory*: This interface represents the factory whose creates an entity manager.
* *ColumnFamilyManager*: The entity manager, that class that interacts with the ColumnEntity, to do a CRUD Operation. This interface might be extended to capture particular behavior in a NoSQL database.
* *ColumnEntity*: The column entity, this interface represents a unit element in a column family. This interface has the column family whose the unit belongs and also its columns.
* *Column*: The column is an element in _ColumnEntity_; it`s a tuple that has key-value whose the key is the name and value is the information.

            Column id = Column.of("id", 10L);

            entity.add(Column.of("version", 0.001));
            entity.add(Column.of("name", "Diana"));
            entity.add(Column.of("options", Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3)));

            entityManager.insert(entity);

            ColumnQuery query = select().from("column family").where(eq(id)).build();
            ColumnQuery query2 = select().from("column family").where("name").eq("Diana").build();

            Optional<ColumnEntity> result = entityManager.singleResult(query);
            System.out.println(result);
